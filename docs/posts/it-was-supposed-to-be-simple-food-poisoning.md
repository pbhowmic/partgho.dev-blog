# _&#8220;When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras&#8221;_

That is a common medical school idiom: Doctors should consider the most likely possibility first when thinking of a
diagnosis.

Here's my story where the hoofbeats turned out to be that of not horses, not zebras but that of a herd of water
buffaloes. And man did I get trampled!

### TL;DR

1. Horses? - My 11-year old daughter has food poisoning. I take her to the pediatrician.
2. Zebras? - No, she has appendicitis. I rush her to the hospital.
3. Water buffaloes! - The pathology report: Appendiceal Neuroendocrine Tumor. More surgery in the offing.
4. Trampled - Yet another surgery and Hurricane Beryl, all in a span of 4 days.
5. A happy ending - Much to be thankful for.

## Prologue

I have been divorced a few years now. I share custody of my 3 kids - my 14-year old son and my 11-year old twin
daughters - with their mother. They alternate weeks living with me and their mother. I don't have family support in town
and there's too much for a single parent to handle, even if I have the kids every alternate week. Blanca came to work
for us when the twins were born - like many twins, they were born with some health issues - and I needed the help. She
is
someone I have trusted to take care of my kids for 11 years now.

## Horses

_Friday, January 26, 2024_ : The kids are with their mother this week. I get a text from her that Eva vomited a few
times. Most likely food poisoning. The strawberries are the prime suspect but she couldn't be sure.

_Monday, January 29, 2024_: It's my week with the kids. The kids come over (Mondays is transition day, that's how we set
it up). Eva is still not feeling great. We take the dogs for a walk on Monday and Tuesday and she cannot walk fast
because it hurts her tummy. A certain amount of post-retching discomfort is to be expected but this feels different.
Pediatrician time.

## Zebras

_Wednesday, January 31, 2024_: I pick Eva from school mid-morning to take her to the pediatrician, who takes not even 5
minutes to diagnose her with appendicitis. We are sent straight to the children's hospital. On the way, I call her
mother. At radiology, she is diagnosed with perforated appendicitis and surgery is scheduled for the same day. All the
while, she has been stoic and taken everything in stride. I make arrangements for my other daughter to go to
after-school childcare, the dogs to be boarded for a few days. I know that I will need to stay overnight with her so I
ask Blanca to stay overnight with the other kids.

As I am doing all this, Eva is being wheeled in to pre-op and that's when she finally breaks down.
Her mother is able to get someone cover her shift and make it to the hospital, before surgery, to see her.
The surgery goes well. The general surgeon sees 200 of these every year. No biggie for him.

I stay overnight at the hospital. Her mother and I work out a new schedule. The other kids go over to her so I can focus
on Eva.

## Thundering herd of water buffaloes

_Friday, February 2, 2024_: Eva makes great post-surgery progress. By Friday evening, the doctor on call is comfortable
releasing her. We decide she needs to avoid going back-and-forth between my home and her mother's, so I drop her off at
her mother's. I go to pick up the dogs from the boarding place before heading home. That's when I get a message from the
hospital. Pathology report has been posted:  **Appendiceal Neuroendocrine Tumor (ANET)**. I have never felt so cold.

## Who has time for grief?

_Friday, February 2, 2024_: I spend the evening calling my closest friends and howling on the phone for many hours.
Patience of the saints must have descended upon them to have listened to me for so long. Another message from the
hospital. Pediatric oncology appointment for the 19<sup>th</sup>.

_Sunday February 18, 2024_: It's time to tell Eva about what the next day's visit is all about. Yet again, she's stoic.
Where does she get her strength and her calmness? I come from a family of anxious people.

_Monday February 19, 2024_: We meet the oncologist. He explains that ANETs are rare and rarer still in children. Almost
all are discovered after appendectomies. <1 % of all appendectomies reveal ANETs. Good news was this one was
well-differentiated G1 tumor. This is to say it is slow growing. Bad news was the pathology reported tumor cells close
to where the appendix was "cut". Positive margins, it's called. He could not be sure there were no tumor cells on the
other side of the cut. Then there was the perforation and the pus that was released. He advised surgery. She would lose
part of her colon and part of her small intestines. The doctor asked Eva if she had any questions. "Will I have to miss
summer camp?" she asked. The great worries of childhood!

_Wednesday February 21, 2024_: Post-op follow up with the general surgeon. He recommends a surgery plan. Since it's a
slow-growth tumor, there's no rush. We decide to schedule surgery sometime after the school year is over.

## Interlude

_School is over. The girls attend camp. Surgery is scheduled for July 5<sup>th</sup>.
I am not worried about the surgery. I am worried about the pathology report.
Will they get everything or is there yet another shoe to drop?
I arrange a hiking trip to Yosemite with my friend. It's not really about the hiking itself.
Last time I came unglued when the pathology report blindsided me.
This time I know that I should not be alone should I get bad news.
Surgery is set for 6-days post-surgery._

## Surgery (again)

_Thursday July 4, 2024_: The kids are with me this week. Happy Independence Day. It's prep day for Eva. Antibiotics.
Colon
cleanse (it's not pleasant). Anti-emetic for the nausea. A day spent on the can. Screw fireworks.

_Friday July 5, 2024_: Eva checks into the hospital. She is calm. That is until she changes into the hospital gown. She
starts sobbing. By the time she is in pre-op, she is back to her stoic self. Her mother came soon afterwards. She is to
stay at the hospital overnight with Eva on this day.

The surgery goes well and I head back home afterwards to the other kids. I am to return the next morning to stay with
Eva for the next 48-hours.

_Sunday, July 7, 2024_: Eva makes better than expected progress and she is discharged early in the evening. This time I
take her home.Meanwhile, Hurricane Beryl has been barreling our way and I am underprepared.

## Rough Weather

_Monday, July 8, 2024_: Hurricane Beryl hits. The kids are to go over their mother's but the roads are impassable. The
kids get to stay with me an extra day. We lose power later in the day. Eva's finally bummed: no more iPad.

_Tuesday, July 9, 2024_: The hurricane has passed. Still no power. It's beginning to get warm and uncomfortable without
the AC. Their mother finally makes it through and picks them up. She has a whole house generator so I know the kids are
better off there. I have a small generator and my internet is still up so I continue to work.

_Thursday, July 11, 2024_: Still no power. It's hot and humid already. It is too hot to sleep but I have to take the
early flight out to Fresno, CA (that's base camp for the hike). I have a 6-hour layover at DFW. There I finally get the
pathology report: **no evidence of tumor** cells. I finally exhaled after 5 months.

## Gratitude

_Saturday, July 13, 2024_: We hike the Misty Trail to Vernal & Nevada Falls.

### A special thanks

I want to thank my boss at the time, whom I cannot name for reasons that will become clear soon. I want to thank
him for his support during a trying time, for giving me the grsce, time and space I needed to care for Eva, accompany
her to her doctors' visits while juggling other parental duties. He is a man of faith and he was called to become a
missionary by his church, in a part of the world that has been known to be hostile to missionaries. I cannot thank him
enough.
